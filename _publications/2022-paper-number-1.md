**Abstract:**

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">    With the continuous development of network security technology，new attacking methods are becomingincreasingly numerous，exposing enterprises to unknown threats that are difficult to identify. User Entity BehaviorAnalytics（UEBA）is an anomaly detection technology to identify potential threat events in user and entity behavior.Ithas been widely used in external intrusion detection and internal threat analysis of enterprises.By using machine learningmethods to model user and entity behavior and identify risk points，UEBA can address unknown threats that are difficultto detect，and enhance the defense of enterprise networks.This paper introduces the development history of UEBA，anddiscusses its applications in statistical learning，deep learning and reinforcement learning. Then the paper presents thestudies of typical UEBA algorithms，and gives comparative analysis of their performance. The paper also describesseveral commonly used public datasets，feature engineering methods，and two feature processing methods that enhancethe accuracy of behavior representation.On this basis，this paper summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of typicalanomaly detection algorithms，and the limitations of internal threat analysis and external intrusion detection.Finally，thefuture research directions in this field are discussed.</p>
