**Abstract:**

 <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> User and Entity Behavior Analysis (UEBA) is an anomaly detection technique that identifies potential threat events in the enterprise's internal threat analysis and external intrusion detection. One limitation of existing methods in UEBA is that many algorithms use deterministic algorithms only for one category labeling and only compare with other samples within this category. In order to improve the efficiency of potential threat identification, we propose MAD-FPC to detect multi-homed abnormal behavior based on particle swarm fuzzy clustering. Using the BF-IEF technology, the method of measuring the similarity of entity and user behavior is optimized. To improve the iterative speed of the fuzzy clustering algorithm, the particle swarm is introduced into the search process of the category centroid. The entity's Nearest Neighbor Relative Anomaly Factor (NNRAF) in multiple fuzzy categories is calculated according to the category membership matrix, and it is combined with Box-plot to detect outliers. Our model solves the problem that the sample in UEBA is evaluated only in one certain class, and the characteristics of the particle swarm optimization algorithm can avoid clustering results falling into local optimal. The results show that compared with the LOF, K-Means, and Random Forest, the abnormal behavior detection ability of the new method is significantly improved, which can improve the ability of information systems to resist unknown threats in practical applications.</p>
