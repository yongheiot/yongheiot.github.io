**Abstract:**

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">  Aiming at the problems of complex behavior of power entities and concealed attack means in the digital active power grid, a multi-category attribution anomaly detection algorithm based on fuzzy clustering was proposed. Firstly, the similarity measurement method of power entity behavior was optimized, a fuzzy clustering algorithm was constructed based on the measurement value, and the membership matrix of entity behavior corresponding to various classes was obtained through several iterations. Then, the nearest neighbor distance, nearest neighbor density, and nearest neighbor relative anomaly factor of entities in each category are calculated according to the category softening membership matrix. Finally, the relative abnormal situation of the entity in various clusters is analyzed to judge whether the behavior of the power entity belongs to the abnormal behavior category. The results show that compared with Local Outlier Factor, K-means, and Random Forest algorithms, the new method has detected more abnormal behaviors and achieved better anomaly detection evaluation indexes. The proposed algorithm solves the problem of a single evaluation angle of samples in traditional anomaly detection algorithms and further improves the ability of the digital active power grid to resist unknown threats.</p>
