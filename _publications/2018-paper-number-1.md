**Abstract:**

 <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">  With the development of information technology in recent years, human being has accumulate a large number of complex types of data structures in production and living in all aspects. The data structure of graph is one of them, and the research on graph mining has gradually become the hotspot in scientific research field. Based on the definition graphs, this paper introduces circles. Simultaneously, the applications of graph data research and the challenges are also briefly analyzed.
