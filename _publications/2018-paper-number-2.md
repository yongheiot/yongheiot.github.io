**Abstract:**

 <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">  For the convenience of finding good authors in a certain field, we apply PageRank algorithm to academic networks through a weighted way to integrate the author's related attributes. Compared with the previous method of calculating
PageRank, this algorithm not only considers the impact of author's paper and author's work organization for the author's influence, but also considers the decay effect of time factor in the process of calculating PageRank.
